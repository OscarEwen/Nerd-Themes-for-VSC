# arduino-themes-vsc README

This Theme adds the themes from the arduino IDE 2.0 into Visual Studio Code, this was inspired by a previous extension designed to the same thing which unfortuanately didn't quite work
in some aspects.

This theme pack current adds:
    - Arduino Light
    - Arduino Dark

Arduino Light.
